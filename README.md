# How to use it!
First wait for 2 seconds to load, once done, you should be able to be waiting for an input like this:

Here you input the first filename, dont inlcude `.db`, and i dont recommend creating or loading a blank database!

**For example:**

we have a folder of files like this

`sqlite3-shell-windows.py`

`test.db`

now lets load our test database to do commands

so we input the filename of database:

`Welcome, please input your first database you wanna load or start creating it
.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------`

`filename of db>test`

then we should have a message saying "Database loaded!" and ready to run sqlite commands!

use `help` during the active session if you want to see the core commands
