# SQLite3-Shell
## Note:
My project for `SQLite3-Shell` is going to be discontinued, that's why i havent updated it for a year. However thanks to [volcanicer](https://github.com/volcanicer), a newer, stable and better version of my shell will be created. I will update the **README.md** for more info and when the new shell will get released but you can still use my shell at any time if you want. Thanks for noticing!

An SQLite3 Shell made in Python, By Me!

# Using the shell:
The Shell is available for both platforms, You can use it anywhere to modify your databases and use the commands!
# Requirements

**Python Version:** Python 3+

**OS:** Windows (Available), Linux (Available)
# How to use it!
First wait for 2 seconds to load, once done, you should be able to be waiting for an input like this:

Here you input the first filename, dont inlcude `.db`, and i dont recommend creating or loading a blank database!

**For example:**

we have a folder of files like this

`sqlite3-shell-windows.py`

`test.db`

now lets load our test database to do commands

so we input the filename of database:

`Welcome, please input your first database you wanna load or start creating it
.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------`

`filename of db>test`

then we should have a message saying "Database loaded!" and ready to run sqlite commands!

use `help` during the active session if you want to see the core commands
